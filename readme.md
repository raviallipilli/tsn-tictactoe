## About the game

- The game is designed to work on web server built on laravel framework. 
- It contains a welcome page to start the game then followed by creating first and second player. 
- The logic is if each of the 3 horizontal or 3 vertical or 3 diagonal moves are selected , then we declare the player as winner else its a tie.
- Game will end if one/both player has all 3 moves equal either in one of these scenario's (h/v/d).
- The game also has a feature to play again with same players or start a new game.
- There is also a stats page to identify the number of games played against each other.

## Improvements

- Registration and Userlogin can be added to the application.
- Big improvement will be extending the feature to play the game remotely.
- Can be improved by generating more stats reports.
- Need to upgrade php version to > 8.
- Potential to upgrade the node version.
- Unit tests needs adding.
